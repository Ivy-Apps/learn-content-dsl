Create an interactive, beginner-friendly lesson to help learners understand $topic. 
The lesson should be:
1. Easy to follow: Use simple, clear language with short sections.
2. Highly visual and example-driven: Include code snippets and real-world analogies to explain concepts.
3. Engaging: Design with questions and activities learners can interact with, emphasizing key concepts.

# Structure:
${structure.mapIndexed { index, bullet -> "${index + 1}. $bullet" }.joinToString(separator = "\n")}

**Tone**: Friendly, encouraging, and engaging, aimed at learners new to algorithms or computer science.

**Learning Goal**: Ensure learners can "$learningGoal" with confidence.

Use only the Kotlin DSL defined belowâ€”no extra structures or deviations.
Ensure that the ids in the lesson are unique and that there are NO duplicated ids.

The lesson should be feel good, logically connected and explain the concept 
assuming no prior knowledge beside: "${priorKnowledge.joinToString(separator = ",")}"

### Example Usage of DSL
```kotlin
fun exampleLesson() = lessonContent {
  intro()
  whyQuestion()
  whyExplanation()
  internalsSection()
  singleCorrectQuestion()
  twoOptionsQuestion()
  multipleCorrectQuestion()
  codeExample()
}

// Introduction

}

// Why Question
private fun LessonContentScope.whyQuestion() {

    question = "Why is this topic important?"
    clarification = "Think about its relevance to problem-solving or understanding concepts."
    answer(text = "Correct Answer", correct = true, explanation = "This highlights the importance of the topic.")
    answer(text = "Incorrect Answer", explanation = "This misses the core reason for the topic's importance.")
    answer(text = "Incorrect Answer 2", explanation = "This answer is unrelated to the topic.")
    answer(text = "Incorrect Answer 3", explanation = "This is an oversimplification and not entirely correct.")
  }
}

// Why Explanation
private fun LessonContentScope.whyExplanation() {
  text("why_explain") {
    text = "An explanation detailing why the topic is relevant and significant in a broader context."
    style = TextStyle.BodySpacingLarge

// Internal Mechanics Section

    text = "A detailed explanation of the internal mechanics or foundational concepts of the topic."
    style = TextStyle.BodySpacingMedium
  }

// Single Correct Answer (1 of 4)

    question = "Which option best represents the core concept?"
    clarification = "Select the most appropriate answer from the options."
    answer(text = "Correct Answer", correct = true, explanation = "This option aligns with the main idea.")
    answer(text = "Option 2", explanation = "This is partially correct but doesn't capture the full idea.")
    answer(text = "Option 3", explanation = "This is incorrect as it misunderstands the concept.")
    answer(text = "Option 4", explanation = "This is unrelated to the topic.")
  }
}

// Two Options Question (1 of 2)
private fun LessonContentScope.twoOptionsQuestion() {
  question("two_options_q") {
    question = "True or False: This concept is applicable to real-world problems."
    clarification = "Consider the practicality of applying this concept."
    answer(text = "True", correct = true, explanation = "Yes, this concept can be applied in many real-world scenarios.")
    answer(text = "False", explanation = "This is incorrect as the concept has practical applications.")
  }
}

// Multiple Correct Answers (N of M)
private fun LessonContentScope.multipleCorrectQuestion() {
  question("multiple_correct_q") {
    question = "Which of the following statements are true about the topic?"
    clarification = "Select all correct answers."
    answer(text = "Statement A", correct = true, explanation = "This is a true statement about the topic.")
    answer(text = "Statement B", explanation = "This is incorrect as it contradicts the topic.")
    answer(text = "Statement C", correct = true, explanation = "This statement aligns with the principles of the topic.")
    answer(text = "Statement D", explanation = "This is not true as it misrepresents the core idea.")
  }
}

// Code Example
private fun LessonContentScope.codeExample() {
  codeExample("code_example") {
    // Use Python for code examples
    text = codeBuilder {

      line("  print(\"This demonstrates the concept effectively.\")")
      line("")
      line("exampleFunction()")
